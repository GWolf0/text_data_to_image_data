# Text Data To Image Data

This app converts a 'text data' into an 'image data', and vice versa, by writing text characters in image rgb values.  
Thus only ASCII characters are supported.  
And it uses a **simple** encryption method (XOR), with an optional key when converting from text to image and vice versa.
